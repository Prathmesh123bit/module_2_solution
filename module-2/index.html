   		<p class="content-name name2">Soup</p>
   		<p class="content">Soup is a primarily liquid food, generally served warm or hot (but may be cool or cold), that is made by
      combining ingredients of meat or vegetables with stock, or water.
      Hot soups are additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients in
      liquids in a pot until the flavors are extracted, forming a broth.
      Soups are similar to stews, and in some cases there may not be a
      clear distinction between the two; however, soups generally have more liquid (broth) than stews</p>

  		<p class="content-name name3">Beef</p>
  		<p class="content">Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle.
       Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times.[1] Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.
       Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting
       into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak
       (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.),
       while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky).
       Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older,
       leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages.</p>
